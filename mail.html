			Here, I will type my question for Kathleen.
The second you pull money out of your 401(k)- without rolling over to an IRA or other 401(k) plan- you incur an immediate income tax liability on the entire amount of the withdrawal. You also lose the benefit of future tax deferral, although this isn’t the end of the world. 
<p>Investment real estate has tax advantages of its own, including the deferral of capital gains tax through 1031 exchanges and just plain holding on to properties, rather than selling. However, rental income is generally taxable outside of retirement plans. <span class='footnote'>&#8212 2 days ago by <pop> me</pop> </span>
