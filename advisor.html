		If you are still employed by the company that sponsors your 401k plan then you will not be eligible to cash out of the plan. Instead, you can see if your plan offers a loan provision, hardship withdrawal or in service withdrawals. Not all plans offer these features so you will need to check with your employer. If you are no longer employed by the company that sponsors your 401k plan, then you are eligible to get your money out of your 401k plan. 
		<br><br>
		You can cash out of the plan or rollover your 401k plan balance to an IRA. If you choose to rollover your 401k plan instead of cashing out, you will not have to pay taxes or penalty taxes as rollovers to IRAs are not taxable transactions if you do them the right way. If you must cash out of your 401k plan and you have not yet reached age 59 1?2 then the dollar amount you cash out will be subject to ordinary income taxes and a 10% penalty tax. Talk to the advisor for your plan to determine the best options for you.

				<span class="green header3">If my employer files for bankruptcy will my 401k fund be frozen for any amount of time?</span>
			</div>
			<div class="comment_body">
Workers in bankruptcy situations face two important issues when it comes to their retirement benefits: access to pension benefits and the continued safety of their pension assets. Generally, your pension assets should not be at risk when a business declares bankruptcy, because ERISA requires that promised pension benefits be adequately funded and that pension monies be kept separate from an employer’s business assets and held in trust or invested in an insurance contract. Thus, if an employer declares bankruptcy, the retirement funds should be secure from the company’s creditors. In addition, plan fiduciaries must comply with the ERISA provisions that prohibit the mismanagement and abuse of plan assets. If contributions to a plan have been withheld from your pay, you may want to confirm that the amounts deducted have been forwarded to the plan’s trust or insurance contract.

				<p>
				Here are some of the questions you should always ask when hiring any financial professional: 
				</p>
				<p>-What experience do you have, especially with people in my circumstances? -Where did you go to school? What is your recent employment history? </p>
				<p>-What licenses do you hold? Are you registered with the SEC, a state, or the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA )? </p>	
				<p>-What products and services do you offer? -Can you only recommend a limited number of products or services to me? If so, why? </p>		
				<p>
				-How are you paid for your services? What is your usual hourly rate, flat fee, or commission? -Have you ever been disciplined by any government regulator for unethical or improper conduct or been sued by a client who was not happy with the work you did? </p>
				<p>-For registered investment advisers, will you send me a copy of both parts of your Form ADV? -Does an independent custodian hold my assets?	</p>
